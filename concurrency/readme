1. Concurrency is the logic to break down a task into smaller independent parallel
processes(not necessarily have to be) and to define the way how processes should coordinate to
accomplis the task by doing the smaller tasks by communicating according to the logic defined
by concurrent program

2. some inherent problems that may arise with an incorrectly implemented concurrent program
    a. Data race(due to accessing shared memory location at the same time)
    b. Deadlock (multiple processes waiting for some resources forever which is
                  acquired by some other process)
        --> read about coffman condition
    c. Starvation (can be avoided with a better resources-allotment algorithm)
